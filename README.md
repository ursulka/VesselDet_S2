# VesselDet_S2
Vessel detection and classification algorithm from Sentinel-2 images in R

"VesselDet_S" is an open-source R package to detect and classify vessels using Sentinel-2 optical images (Level 1C). 

This algorithm is adapted and tested on Level 1C Sentinel-2 images. The results using Level 2A might differ (worsen) due to different values of pixels. 

The paper where complete procedure is described more in detail is currently under review in the journal Acta Astronautica and is titled "Detecting migrant vessels in the Mediterranean Sea: Using Sentinel-2 images to aid humanitarian actions".
