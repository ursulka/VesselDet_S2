# VesselDet_S2
Vessel detection and classification algorithm from Sentinel-2 images in R

"VesselDet_S" is an open-source R package to detect and classify vessels using Sentinel-2 optical images (Level 1C). 

This algorithm is adapted and tested on Level 1C Sentinel-2 images. The results using Level 2A might differ (worsen) due to other values of pixels.
