# VesselDet_S2
Vessel detection and classification algorithm from Sentinel-2 images in R

"VesselDet_S" is an open-source R package to detect and classify vessels using Sentinel-2 optical images (Level 1C). 

This algorithm is adapted and tested on Level 1C Sentinel-2 images. The results using Level 2A might differ (worsen) due to other values of pixels. 

The paper where complete procedure is described more in detail is currently under review and is titled "How can Sentinel-2 images assist humanitarian actions to help reduce the loss of life in the Mediterranean Sea?"
